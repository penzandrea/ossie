Responsibility in this context is defined as \"a reason for change\". If there is more than one motive for changing a class, then that class has more than one responsibility.

There shall always be different methods for these two types of access."},{"id":408,"name":"ISE","description":"The principle emphasizes that interfaces have to used solely (see also principle 'Program to an interface, not an implementation'). Nevertheless, the principle goes one step further. It additionally enforces complete separation of interface and implementation; thus a client (just as an example) must not even instantiate an implementing class!\n\nMany dynamic component models like OSGi separate abstract types and implementation types. This separation facilitates service-oriented programming where service implementation providers are dynamically associated with service consumers through dependency injection techniques. In particular, this enables the dynamic swapping of service providers with minimal impact on the service consumers. This approach is common in OSGi based applications like Eclipse (extension points (interface) and extensions (concrete implementation). Other OSGi extensions such as Declarative Services and Spring Dynamic Modules use similar mechanisms.\n\nTo take advantage of these platforms, interfaces and implementations need to be separated, and the dependencies between them must be minimized. In fact, the Interface Separability Principle measures how easily this can be done."}]},{"id":407,"name":"ENC","description":"","children":[{"id":410,"name":"IHI","description":"Information Hiding is the ability to prevent certain parts (implementation) of a class or component from being accessible to clients.\n\nThe basic idea is that if code chunk A doesn't really need to know something about how code chunk B (which it calls) does its job, don't make it know it. Then, when that part of B changes, you don't have to go back and change A.\n\nEncapsulation can have a different meaning, too: it means collecting a bunch of stuff together and putting it in one box, or capsule. The box may or may not have opaque walls, so this may or may not involve information hiding. In practice a \"class\" will both encapsulate (i.e., bundle code and data together) and hide information (namely, implementation detail), and some people get so used to doing both at once they no longer bother to distinguish.

The author distinguishes between imposed and inadvertent duplication:\n\n*  Imposed Duplication\n        ** Multiple representations of information: This is about duplicated data structures caused by external forces, like different programming languages. This type of problem cannot be covered by us.\n        ** Documentation in code: Lower level documentation is kept directly in the code - higher level documentation should be minimal in order to avoid duplicates. We could claim here that packages, classes and public methods should be well documented; on the other hand inline-comments in methods or functions should be minimal.\n        ** Documentation and code: Documentation should fit with the code. Parts of this can be checked by assuring that references to web pages, references to other parts of the code, references to argument names, exceptions, type of return values, etc. are correct. \n*  Inadvertent Duplication\n        ** This topic deals with unnecessary caches, i.e., values that can be computed from other (instance) variables. This needs semantic understanding and can hardly be checked. \n*  Impatient Duplication and Interdeveloper Duplication\n        ** This is about classical duplication topics, i.e., duplicated internal code, code reused and changed from external libraries (difficult to detect).

This assumes that the software entity has been given a well-defined, stable description (its interface in the sense of information hiding). At the implementation level, closure for a entity also implies that you may compile it, perhaps store it in a library, and make it available for others (its clients) to use.
